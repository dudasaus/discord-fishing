# Battles

Each week, you get up to 7 fish. If we battle once per week, that gives you 7 options to choose from. Let's say you can form a full team with 4. This means fishing more is always advantageous because you have more choices, but you aren't severely disadvantaged if you fished at least 4 times.

1 fish represents your "hero", the base stats that takes the hits.

3 fish represent your moves- each fish has a certain dice, and what you roll determines your move on your turn. Dice can have blank sides- essentially a miss.

If the player doesn't have 4 fish, they have to pick from default options- let's call the default options slightly worse than basic blue fish.

## Rough ideas for fish types

### Blue fish

Basic fish - slightly stronger than default options, but not very good.

### Tropical fish

Basic, but a little stronger than the blue fish in most aspects.

### Shark

Strong attacker - specifically, would be cool if this could hard counter whales.

### Shrimp

Weak attack/health, but has strong support opportunities.

### Crab

Strong defensive moves. Maybe the hard shell is a shark counter.

### Lobster

Decent attack and defense, not too special. Maybe one strong dice move.

### Dolphin

Support type, like the shrimp. But better base stats in turn for weaker support moves.

### Whale

Super strong base stats.

### Octopus

Mostly basic moves?

### Squid

Strong base stats with more specialty moves.
